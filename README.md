# 面試準備

2 mins: Ask 3-4 clarifying questions to gather all requirements from the interviewer (Scope the problem!). Ensure all parameters are clear in your mind. Do NOT jump in to solve the question before clarifying the requirements of the question!

 

8-10 mins: Proposing a valid solution and an alternative approach. Discuss the trade offs to get to the most optimized solution. Explain your approach and rationale of choosing the data structures and algorithms used in your solution. Independently analyze time and space complexity.


5 mins: Code and implement a full working solution. Don't forget to cover for edge and boundary cases!


5 mins: Dry run (sample test cases) along with discussion with the interviewer, take this time to fix bugs.


Coming up with the working solution first is important!
Remember that you can also use brute force and optimize it along the way!

## 思路

1. 求上下邊界
   1. Binary Search(排序)
   2. Binary Search Tree(排序)
   3. Line Sweep(排序)
   4. TreeMap
2. 求群組隸屬／總合
   1. Union Find

3. Subsequence求和
   1. 陣列的順序不重要 => 考慮是否要直接排序
4. 鄰接消除
   1. Stack(Leetcode括號消除)
